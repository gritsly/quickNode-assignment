Infrastructure Take Home Project

The intent of this assignment is to look at your problem solving skills and thought
process, not any specific technology; any tools or programming languages can be used
for this. When finished, please create a tar of the code you used and anything else you
think is relevant to share with us to understand how you got to the solution you did.
The project should take around an hour so please scope out the prompt and account for
how you plan to solve the problem. It doesn’t need to be a complex solution, but again
we are looking to vet your technical skillset while understanding how you would go
about coming to that solution.

If you have any questions or need clarification on anything, feel free to reach out via
email at kristina@quicknode.com.
1. Write a simple daemon that responds with 329d4feb-c5c0-4de5-b10c-701b44fbec4f to a
GET request at the /test URI ( eg http://198.199.115.88/test )
2. Automate the deployment of the daemon to the server provided below. Feel free to
use any tools/strategies for this. This should be bare minimum “productionized” (For
example, be able to survive machine restarts or crashes, etc)
3. Please include a README with a brief description of your rationale behind the
deployment automation and strategy and anything else that would provide context.
